# Introduction to Bash and Git
_Brainhack Marseille, 27th January 2026, 12h00-13h00_

This introduction to Bash and Git will strongly rely on the Carpentries courses [Introduction to Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Introduction to Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). We will cover basics of both courses, but don't have enough time to go into detail. Please use this session to get started working through the course material independently.
