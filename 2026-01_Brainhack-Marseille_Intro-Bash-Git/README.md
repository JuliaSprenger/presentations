# Introduction to Bash and Git
_Brainhack Marseille, 27th January 2026, 12h00-13h00_

This type-along introduction to Bash and Git will strongly rely on the Carpentries courses [Introduction to Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Introduction to Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). We will cover basics of both courses, but don't have enough time to go into detail. Please use this session to get started working through the course material independently.

## How to prepare
Follow the install instructions to set up the [Bash Shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#the-bash-shell) and [Git](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git-1) on your system. For the use of github.com, please don't forget to bring your mobile phone (or any other 2nd factor), so you can log in to github.
