## What is not part of this

---

### ***time*** for improvements not directly contributing to the scientific progress, e.g.
  - infrastructure software development
  - refactoring / restructuring of code
  - long term maintenance of code

---

### ***education*** of software development skills
  - best practices for code style
  - quality assurance
    - test driven development
    - continuous integration
  - version control
  - validation

---

### ***money*** for
  - software development training courses
  - non-scientific software developers
  - software infrastructure (IT, self hosted services, ...)

---

## Additional issues

---

### ***trust***
  - for **seemingly** small projects software is quickly self-implemented
  - for **complex** projects commercial software **seems** more reliable

---

### ***trust***
  - publication comes first, software release _maybe_ later
  - making errors is taboo, reputation issue
  - publishing code pushes scientific progress
      - Pioneering in code publication <br>
       [Izhikevich (2006) Polychronization: Computation with Spikes](https://doi.org/10.1162/089976606775093882)
      - Reimplementation and examination <br>
       [Pauli et al. (2018) Reproducing Polychronization: A Guide to Maximizing the Reproducibility of Spiking Network Models](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2018.00046)

---

### ***dedication***
  - software development is a side occupation
    - no extended time reserved for this
    - not continuous task, but on demand
    - has a low priority compared to scientific findings and publications

  - rapid changes in staff & small / not clearly defined user base
  - no dedicated team per software project <br> funding usually supports individuals
  - focus on numeric precision

## What can you do?

### ... as software developer
  - talk to scientists to discover new interesting problems
  - get involved in existing scientific projects and provide feedback


  - make your documentation readable by non-experts, _'installation for dummies'_
  - advertise existing software within potential user community (conferences, workshops)

---

### ... as scientific open software project

  - involve a large user (and potential contributor) base
  - simplify usage and contribution on all levels
      * user & developer guide
      * tutorials
      * solve simple issues first
      * define project standards and contribution guide
  - advertise within potential user community

---

### ... as scientist

  - use existing open source tools, don't start from scratch
  - make sure your software outlives your career
      - [bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org)
  - create links to other packages
  - integrate your project into larger framework

  - consider software development aspects from the beginning

## Recommendations for institutes

  - provide kickstart in basic software development techniques
      - version control, coding standards, CI
      - pair programming, test driven development, code review
      - <strike> scrum </strike>, kanban
  - have a dedicated software coordinator
  - define project standards
  - organize hackathons / topic weeks / workshops

## Differences Academia & Business

 - Academia
      - reputation of an individual counts
      - longer software development cycles
      - main focus: scientific results & paper publications

 - Business
      - reputation of company counts
      - scrum style software development cycles
      - main focus: product development & marketing

## Stages of scientific software

1) custom code for experiment specific task (e.g. experiment control)
    - for current use only
    - no documentation
    - no reuse possible
    - not maintainable
    - not shareable

---

2) shared code within a small community
    - used by multiple people
    - sparsely documented
    - maintained for the duration of a project
    - reuse would require modifications

---

3) globally shared code
    - used in different projects
    - well documented
    - maintained across projects



---
## Growing number of scientific open software projects & code
  - Increasing awareness of software as scientific basis [Katerbow & Feulner (2018): Recommendations on the Development, Use and Provision of Research Software, Research Software Working Group of the Alliance of German Science Organisations](https://zenodo.org/record/1172988)
  - Funding initiatives will require code & software publication
